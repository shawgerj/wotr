This project is built using CMake. Build tooling in rust-rocksdb
should take care of all this when building the whole project, but it
can be useful to build manually if testing RocksDB+XLL in isolation.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

The project was renamed at some point from WOTR to XLL... hence the
different names here.
